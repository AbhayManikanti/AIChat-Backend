# AI Chatbot Backend

This project is a scalable and modular backend for an AI-powered chatbot, designed to provide intelligent, context-aware conversations. Built with **FastAPI** and **LangChain**, the backend is capable of handling multiple users simultaneously while delivering fast and coherent responses.

## Features

- **Context-Aware Conversations:** Maintains conversation history and context dynamically to generate relevant and coherent replies.  
- **AI Integration:** Uses advanced language models (like GPT variants) via LangChain for natural and engaging conversational AI.  
- **RESTful API:** Provides clean API endpoints for easy integration with any frontend application, mobile app, or web service.  
- **Prompt Management:** Implements dynamic prompt engineering for tailoring AI responses to specific use-cases or domains.  
- **Third-Party API Support:** Can integrate with external APIs and databases to fetch real-time information for users.  
- **Performance Optimized:** Asynchronous request handling, logging, and error management ensure reliability and low latency under load.  

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – Core programming language  
- **FastAPI** – High-performance web framework for building APIs  
- **LangChain** – Framework for managing and integrating LLMs  
- **Asyncio / Uvicorn** – Asynchronous server for high-performance API handling  

## Use Cases

- AI-powered chat interfaces for websites or apps  
- Intelligent customer support systems  
- Conversational agents for internal tools or knowledge bases  
- Experimentation with advanced prompt engineering and AI workflows  

This backend is designed to be modular, easy to extend, and production-ready, making it suitable for both experimentation and real-world deployment.
