   - Check logs for file permission errors

3. **Service Not Starting**:
   - Check the build logs for dependency issues
   - Verify all environment variables are set

### Health Check Endpoints:
- `GET /` - Basic health check
- `GET /health` - Detailed system status
- `GET /info` - API information and capabilities

## üéâ Success!
